# generator-noderplate

> Generate Node.js starter files with just one command!

We have deployed a npm package that will generate a boilerplate for nodejs backend development. The boilerplate contains code files & folders, that are common in almost all nodejs projects.

## Tools and Technologies used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [YEOMAN](https://yeoman.io/)

## Usage

You have to first install two of the below mentioned npm packages globally in order to use our package.

1. `npm install -g yo`
2. `npm install -g generator-noderplate`

Now, you have to just enter the below command in every node project you are going to build.
- `yo noderplate`

#### WARNING! 
In some systems, the above mentioned command `yo noderplate` might not work/run due to an ExecutionPolicy error(only for Windows users).
In that case, please follow the below given steps:
> - Open Windows PowerShell and run it as Adminstrator.
> - Execute the following command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`.
> - Press Y to continue and this will resolve the issue.
> - run again the command `yo noderplate` on your terminal.

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Once the boilerplate has been generated enter the below command to view your server running locally at a certain port:
```
npm start
```
